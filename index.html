They also use cat specific body language.</p>

    	<p>Domestic cat habitat is centred around its home but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point. Some live only indoors, though many live outdoors too. Some domestic cats have a habitat range of 7-28 hectares!</p>
		<p>Cats do well in all climates, but prefer places where the winters are not severely cold. Now, they occupy nearly every country in the world except for Antarctica and a few islands.</p>
		<p>They sometimes mark trees, fence posts, and furniture with their claws or their waste to communicate and mark their territory. They also make a range of sounds to communicate, including purring, screeching, hissing and mewling.</p>
		<p>The feral cat habitat is slightly different, as feral cats are domesticated cats that now live in the wild. This means that they are unfamiliar with humans and roam freely in urban areas. They can also live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.</p>
